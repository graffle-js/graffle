# Local Claude Rules for Graffle Project

## CRITICAL: Generated Files

**NEVER EDIT GENERATED FILES**

- Any file in `__tests__/fixtures/*/modules/` directories is GENERATED
- These files are created by generator scripts and should NEVER be manually edited
- If there are issues with generated files, fix the generator code, not the generated output
- Always regenerate fixtures using the appropriate pnpm scripts after fixing generators

Generated file patterns to NEVER edit:

- `src/extensions/DocumentBuilder/__tests__/fixtures/*/modules/*.ts`
- Any file that has been marked as generated or comes from a generator script
