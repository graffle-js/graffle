  # Row 1
  - title: Spec Compliant
    details: Graffle complies with the <a href="https://graphql.github.io/graphql-over-http">GraphQL over HTTP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec">GraphQL Multipart Request</a> specifications.
    icon: üé´
  - title: Extensible
    details: Powerful type-safe extension system. Intercept and manipulate inputs, outputs, and core with hooks; Add new methods; And more.
    icon: üß∞
  - title: Ecosystem
    details: Meet real-world project needs with extensions for common and niche needs like OpenTelemetry, file uploads, schema errors, and more.
    icon: üì¶
  - title: Multi-Transport
    details: Not just a great way to query GraphQL APIs. Execute documents against in-memory schemas just as easily with the same interface.
    icon: üöõ
  # Row 2
  - title: Custom Scalars
    details: Easily add client-side codecs for custom scalars in the schema to enable automatic encoding of arguments and decoding of data on every request.
    icon: üßô
  - title: Document Builder
    details: Optional TypeScript alternative to GQL syntax for building type-safe documents including tailored methods for root fields, batch method for multiple root fields, and a document method for 1:1 with GraphQL.
    icon: ü™µ
  - title: Type Safe Results <br/><span style="opacity:0.25;">( Document Builder )</span>
    details: Automatically inferred type safe results based on your document's structure including selection sets, aliases, directives, inline fragments, unions, and more.
    icon: ‚õëÔ∏è
  - title: Schema Errors<br/><span style="opacity:0.25;">( Extension )</span>
    details: First class support for schemas that have modelled errors into their design. Result Fields can be made to throw on errors or automatically map to error classes.
    icon: üé≤
  # Row 3
  - title: Static Document Builder
    details: Generate typed GraphQL documents at compile-time without a client instance. Perfect for passing to other GraphQL clients or building tools. Zero runtime overhead.
    icon: üìÑ
  - title: Output Modes
    details: Control error handling patterns with envelope mode (wrap results), return-error mode (errors as values), or throw mode. Configure globally or per-request.
    icon: üìÆ
  - title: Type-Safe Native GraphQL Syntax
    details: Full type inference for GraphQL documents using standard GraphQL syntax. Write queries and mutations with complete IDE autocomplete and type safety alongside the document builder.

::: warning Pre-Release Software
Graffle is [still in development](https://github.com/graffle-js/graffle/discussions/1163). Install with `npm install graffle@next graphql` to use the latest pre-release version.
:::

## Quick Start

```ts twoslash
import { Graffle } from 'graffle'

const graffle = Graffle
  .create()
  .transport({ url: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql' })

const data = await graffle.gql`
  query {
    countries(filter: { name: { in: ["Canada", "Germany", "Japan"] } }) {
      name
      capital
      emoji
    }
  }
`.send()

console.log(data)
//          ^?
```

## Why Choose Graffle?

Graffle combines the **simplicity of graphql-request** with **powerful type safety** and **extensibility**.

**Choose Graffle if you want:**

- **Full Type Safety** - Complete type inference for GraphQL documents and results, with optional Document Builder for TypeScript-native query construction
- **Flexibility** - Start simple with raw GraphQL strings, progressively adopt type-safe features as needed
- **Extensibility** - Powerful extension system for OpenTelemetry, schema errors, custom scalars, and more
- **Multi-Transport** - Execute against HTTP APIs or in-memory schemas with the same interface

**Consider UI-specialized clients if:**

- You're building a React/Vue/Svelte app and want deep framework integration with hooks, suspense, and state management ([Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), [Urql](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/urql/), or [Relay](https://relay.dev/))
