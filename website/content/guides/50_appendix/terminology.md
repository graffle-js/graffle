### SDDM

Abbreviation for [Schema Driven Data Map](#schema-driven-data-map).

### Schema Map

Shorter non-abbreviated name to refer to [Schema Driven Data Map](#schema-driven-data-map).

### Schema Driven Data Map

A data structure that contains just enough information about the schema to enable specialized runtime features. It is optimized for supporting small bundle sizes (hence "just enough information").

It is an implementation detail that your code should not have to interact with or know about.

As much as possible, Graffle's features avoid needing this data structure so that bundles remains as small as possible. So, by default, Graffle does NOT use this data structure. Only when opting into certain features will it become needed.

It is generated by the Graffle generator.

It can be extended by extensions.

Some features that require SDDM:

1. [Custom Scalars](./05_custom_scalars.md)
2. [Schema Errors]('../../extensions/schema-errors.md')
