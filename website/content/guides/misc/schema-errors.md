# Schema Errors

There is a GraphQL schema design pattern that advocates for encoding errors into your schema. It generally has two parts: One, objects that represent errors; Two, root fields that return unions of one success object and multiple error objects. The benefit of this approach is letting users know about error states and enabling clients to receive them in a type safe way. The general net positive is higher quality and easier to develop software.

## Generation

This pattern has first class support. By default all objects whose name begin with `Error` will be considered to be "error objects". You can customize this at generate time with your own regular expression.

## Toggle

You can disable schema errors by disabling the generation in the first place or adjusting your constructor.

```ts
const client = Client.create({ schemaErrors: false })
```

## `isError`

You can use a helper function `isError` that will narrow objects to just error objects. For example:

```ts
const result = await client.mutation.foo()
if (isError(result)) {
  result // type is narrowed to just errors
} else {
  result // type is narrowed to just success
}
```
