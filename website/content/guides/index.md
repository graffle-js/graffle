# Introduction

Graffle's website documentation is primarily divided between these guides and [examples](../examples/index.md). Detailed reference information is largely left to JSDoc and TypeScript types. However, thanks to [Twoslash](https://twoslash.netlify.app) that information is also made available within the website docs.

Guides are built around domains rather than technical locality so for example many aspects of configuration are embedded into each one's respective area of concern like [HTTP Transport](transports/http.md) or [Output](10_overview/output.md). Throughout, guides reference [Examples](../examples/raw) in context helping you jump between theory and practice. As well, know that all examples are automatically tested in Graffle's continuous integration so you can be confident in their functionality.
