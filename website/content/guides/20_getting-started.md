# Getting Started

This short guide will take you from basic usage to use of the optional document builder.

Node with pnpm is used here but any package manager as well as Deno and Bun users should be able to follow along.

## üè° Setup Your Project

If you don't already have a project, create one:

```sh
pnpm init
```

<!-- TODO use formatter to make generated code readable -->

We're going to use TypeScript for this project but you don't have to.

- [`tsx`](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx) makes running TypeScript files easy.
- [`@tsconfig/strictest`](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases/blob/main/bases/strictest.json) makes having strict TypeScript settings easy.

```sh
pnpm add --save-dev typescript tsx @tsconfig/strictest
```

```sh
touch tsconfig.json main.ts
```

```json tsconfig.json
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "Node16",
    "moduleResolution": "Node16"
  }
}
```

## üì¶ Install Graffle

Graffle is [still in development](https://github.com/graffle-js/graffle/discussions/1163) so there is no stable release to install yet. Use the `next` distribution tag to find the latest pre-release.

Graffle has a peer dependency on `graphql` so you will need to install that too.

```sh
pnpm add graffle@next graphql
```

## üíÄ Verify Project Configuration

Graffle is an [ESM only package built around package `exports`](https://github.com/graffle-js/graffle/discussions/863). This imposes a few requirements on your project configuration.

1. One of:
   - Your project is using ESM ([`"type": "module"`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#type)).
   - Your project is using CJS with [`node@^22.12.0`](https://bsky.app/profile/kuhrt.me/post/3lckonbltrs2i) or `node@^20.17` with [`--experimental-require-module`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--experimental-require-module).
2. _If you are using TypeScript_:
   1. If you are using TypeScript your `tsconfig.json` must set `module` and [`moduleResolution`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#moduleResolution) to `Node16` or `Bundler`. Otherwise TypeScript will not be able to find the types when you attempt to import entrypoints from `graffle`.
   2. Your TypeScript version must be `typescript@^4.9`.
3. _If you are using React Native_:
   1. [Do this](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/06/21/package-exports-support#enabling-package-exports-beta) to enable support for package `exports`.

## üöÄ Send Your First Document

Now you're ready to send your first GraphQL document. We'll use a publicly available GraphQL API (Thanks [Trevor](https://trevorblades.com)!). Create a Graffle instance and then use it to send a document.

```ts twoslash
// @filename: main.ts

import { Graffle } from 'graffle'

const graffle = Graffle
  .create()
  .transport({
    url: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql',
  })

const data = await graffle.gql`
  query myQuery ($filter: [String!]) {
    countries (filter: { name: { in: $filter } }) {
      name
      continent {
        name
      }
    }
  }
`
  .send({ filter: [`Canada`, `Germany`, `Japan`] })

console.log(data)
//          ^?
```

```json
{
  "countries": [
    { "name": "Canada", "continent": { "name": "North America" } },
    { "name": "Germany", "continent": { "name": "Europe" } },
    { "name": "Japan", "continent": { "name": "Asia" } }
  ]
}
```

## üßô Meet Document Builder

You could stop here if you want, but if you're curious about Graffle's document builder (aka. "query builder") continue on!

The document builder is an alternative to the GraphQL document syntax. With it, you express GraphQL documents in JavaScript. And thanks to Graffle's powerful types all inputs (GraphQL arguments) and outputs (execution results) are type safe ‚ú®. The document builder is a Graffle extension. By not hardcoding this feature into core, we keep Graffle lean and bundle sizes smaller for users that are not leveraging it.

To access the document builder you have to use the extension _and_ perform a code generation step. Let's begin with code generation. When you installed `graffle` you also gained access to a command line interface (CLI) in your project. Use it now to generate code that will augment your client.

```sh
pnpm graffle --schema https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql
```

You will see a directory named `graffle` has been created in the current working directory. The generated code within augments a global TypeScript type that Graffle's static code knows about. The result is the illusion of new client methods available to you but in reality its actually just a Proxy instance that was there all along, dynamically receiving all the property requests. In other words you have just generated some code but nothing about the _runtime_ has actually changed. Feel free to poke around at the files. Notice how the vast majority is just types (we can ignore the runtime parts for now).

```
|
|- graffle/
|  |- ...
|
```

Note let's use the extension and rewrite our GraphQL document using the document builder. You should notice some new client methods in your IDE like `.document` and `.query.countries`.

```ts
// todo twoslash
// @filename: main.ts

import { Graffle } from 'graffle'
import { DocumentBuilder } from 'graffle/extensions/document-builder'

const graffle = Graffle
  .create()
  .transport({
    url: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql',
  })
  .use(DocumentBuilder())

const data = await graffle.document({
  query: {
    myQuery: {
      countries: {
        $: {
          filter: { name: { in: [`Canada`, `Germany`, `Japan`] } },
        },
        name: true,
        continent: {
          name: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}).send()

console.log(data)
//          ^?
```

```json
{
  "countries": [
    { "name": "Canada", "continent": { "name": "North America" } },
    { "name": "Germany", "continent": { "name": "Europe" } },
    { "name": "Japan", "continent": { "name": "Asia" } }
  ]
}
```

## üßπ Simplify With Root Fields

The `.document` method is 1:1 with the GraphQL document syntax in regards to what it can express. Graffle also gives you dedicated methods for each root field (fields on `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription`) which can be simpler depending on your use-case. Let's refactor our code with it.

```ts
// ...

const data = await graffle.document.query.countries({
  $: { filter: { name: { in: [`Canada`, `Germany`, `Japan`] } } },
  name: true,
  continent: {
    name: true,
  },
})

// ...
```

## üß∞ Utilities

Graffle gives you utilities beyond the direct client itself. For example you can build up reusable selection sets:

::: code-group

```ts twoslash [Graffle Namespace]
import { Graffle } from './graffle/__.js'

const ContinentSelection = Graffle.Select.Continent({ name: true })
```

```ts twoslash [Barrel Import]
import { Select } from './graffle/_.js'

const ContinentSelection = Select.Continent({ name: true })
```

:::

You can also do the same thing at the type level which can sometimes be handy when you want to define data types based on selection sets.

::: code-group

```ts twoslash [Graffle Namespace]
import { type Graffle } from './graffle/__.js'

type Continent = Graffle.Select.Continent<{ name: true }>
```

```ts twoslash [Barrel Import]
import { type Select } from './graffle/_.js'

type Continent = Select.Continent<{ name: true }>
```

Refer to the [Selection Sets Example](/examples/70_type-level/selection-sets.md) for more detail about type level features the generator provides you.
